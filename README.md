# PlantUML Themes

This repository is my personal library of PlantUML themes.

## Usage

``` text
!theme elegant from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Townk/plantumllib/master/themes
```

Once you add this line to your PlantUML diagram, you can use some helper functions to define extra content on your diagram:

- `$setTitle(text)` :: as the name implies, define the title of your diagram;
- `$setLegend(color1,name1,color2,name2,...)` :: define a colored legend for your diagram;
